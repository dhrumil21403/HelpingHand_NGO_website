# HelpingHand_NGO_website
This is my Computer Engineering Final year project developed using Python Django.
Helping Hand is a web application which is made for an NGO.
Using this web application a user can donate the foods, clothes, money, medicines etc. without going anywhere at any time from any place.
Volunteer can also connect to this NGO using this web application and can help NGO in taking & delivering things from the user who wants to donate.
Even using this system user can register for event if he/she wants to celebrate the event at NGO but for this approval from NGO is must.
